# A-Taste-of-Study-Abroad
- A cooking guide created for clumsy international students who never cooked at home but had to learn to cook after studying abroad.
- The aim is to find recipes that are easy to follow, tasty, and with ingredients that are easy to find.
- I need to learn how to cook, I don't really have a choice.
